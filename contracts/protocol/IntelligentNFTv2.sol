 *
 * @notice iNFT stores AI Personality and some amount of ALI tokens locked, available for
 *      unlocking when iNFT is destroyed
 *
 * @notice iNFT is not an ERC721 token, but it has some very limited similarity to an ERC721:
 *      every record is identified by ID and this ID has an owner, which is effectively the target NFT owner;
 *      still, it doesn't store ownership information itself and fully relies on the target ownership instead
 *
 * @dev Internally iNFTs consist of:
 *      - target NFT - smart contract address and ID of the NFT the iNFT is bound to
 *      - AI Personality - smart contract address and ID of the AI Personality used to produce given iNFT,
 *        representing a "personality prompt", and locked within an iNFT
 *      - ALI tokens amount - amount of the ALI tokens used to produce given iNFT, also locked
 *
 * @dev iNFTs can be
 *      - created, this process requires an AI Personality and ALI tokens to be locked
 *      - destroyed, this process releases an AI Personality and ALI tokens previously locked
