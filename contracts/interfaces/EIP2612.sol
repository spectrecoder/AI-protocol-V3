 * @title EIP-2612: permit - 712-signed approvals
 *
 * @notice A function permit extending ERC-20 which allows for approvals to be made via secp256k1 signatures.
 *      This kind of “account abstraction for ERC-20” brings about two main benefits:
 *        - transactions involving ERC-20 operations can be paid using the token itself rather than ETH,
 *        - approve and pull operations can happen in a single transaction instead of two consecutive transactions,
 *        - while adding as little as possible over the existing ERC-20 standard.
 *
 * @notice See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification
