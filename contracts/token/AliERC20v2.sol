/**
 * @title Artificial Liquid Intelligence ERC20 Token (Alethea, ALI)
 *
 * @notice ALI is the native utility token of the Alethea AI Protocol.
 *      It serves as protocol currency, participates in iNFTs lifecycle,
 *      (locked when iNFT is created, released when iNFT is destroyed,
 *      consumed when iNFT is upgraded).
 *      ALI token powers up the governance protocol (Alethea DAO)
 *
 * @notice Token Summary:
 *      - Symbol: ALI
 *      - Name: Artificial Liquid Intelligence Token
 *      - Decimals: 18
 *      - Initial/maximum total supply: 10,000,000,000 ALI
 *      - Initial supply holder (initial holder) address: 0x0738F702D1a7364d356729Cb8845701885C487A1 (configurable)
 *      - Mintability: configurable (initially enabled, but possible to revoke forever)
 *      - Burnability: configurable (initially enabled, but possible to revoke forever)
 *      - DAO Support: supports voting delegation
 *
 * @notice Features Summary:
 *      - Supports atomic allowance modification, resolves well-known ERC20 issue with approve (arXiv:1907.00903)
 *      - Voting delegation and delegation on behalf via EIP-712 (like in Compound CMP token) - gives the token
 *        powerful governance capabilities by allowing holders to form voting groups by electing delegates
 *      - Unlimited approval feature (like in 0x ZRX token) - saves gas for transfers on behalf
 *        by eliminating the need to update “unlimited” allowance value
 *      - ERC-1363 Payable Token - ERC721-like callback execution mechanism for transfers,
 *        transfers on behalf and approvals; allows creation of smart contracts capable of executing callbacks
 *        in response to transfer or approval in a single transaction
 *      - EIP-2612: permit - 712-signed approvals - improves user experience by allowing to use a token
 *        without having an ETH to pay gas fees
 *      - EIP-3009: Transfer With Authorization - improves user experience by allowing to use a token
 *        without having an ETH to pay gas fees
 *
 * @dev Even though smart contract has mint() function which is used to mint initial token supply,
 *      the function is disabled forever after smart contract deployment by revoking `TOKEN_CREATOR`
 *      permission from the deployer account
 *
 * @dev Token balances and total supply are effectively 192 bits long, meaning that maximum
 *      possible total supply smart contract is able to track is 2^192 (close to 10^40 tokens)
 *
 * @dev Smart contract doesn't use safe math. All arithmetic operations are overflow/underflow safe.
 *      Additionally, Solidity 0.8.7 enforces overflow/underflow safety.
 *
 * @dev Multiple Withdrawal Attack on ERC20 Tokens (arXiv:1907.00903) - resolved
 *      Related events and functions are marked with "arXiv:1907.00903" tag:
 *        - event Transfer(address indexed _by, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
 *        - event Approve(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _oldValue, uint256 _value)
 *        - function increaseAllowance(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool)

 * @dev Compound-like voting delegation functions', public getters', and events' names
 *      were changed for better code readability (Alethea Name <- Comp/Zeppelin name):
 *      - votingDelegates           <- delegates
 *      - votingPowerHistory        <- checkpoints
 *      - votingPowerHistoryLength  <- numCheckpoints
 *      - totalSupplyHistory        <- _totalSupplyCheckpoints (private)
 *      - usedNonces                <- nonces (note: nonces are random instead of sequential)
 *      - DelegateChanged (unchanged)
 *      - VotingPowerChanged        <- DelegateVotesChanged
 *      - votingPowerOf             <- getCurrentVotes
 *      - votingPowerAt             <- getPriorVotes
 *      - totalSupplyAt             <- getPriorTotalSupply
 *      - delegate (unchanged)
 *      - delegateWithAuthorization <- delegateBySig
 * @dev Compound-like voting delegation improved to allow the use of random nonces like in EIP-3009,
