## Table of Contents

[TOC]

## Overview

The goal of the release v2.8 is to bring ALI token into BNB and opBNB networks.

## Dates

- **August 29th**: Start date
- **September 5th**: First report

## Process

This document, and all suggestions detailed here, is meant to be scrutinized and
discussed between both parties, in an ongoing collaborative process after the
first report delivery. Each suggestion may not be needed due to contextual
reasons, or limited understanding of external scope by the auditor.

## Coverage

The following repositories were considered in-scope for the review:

- https://github.com/AletheaAI/alethea-contracts (revision `5576303`)

In particular, this audit focuses solely on the following contracts:

- `AliERC20v2.sol with`
- `OpBnbAliERC20v2.sol`
- `LzERC20RootTunnelV1`
- `LzERC20ChildTunnelV1`

In addition, the corresponding deploy scripts and LayerZero configuration are also in scope.

## Areas of Concern

The investigation focused on the following:

- Looking for attack vectors that could impact the intended behaviour of the
  smart contract
- Checking test coverage, particularly for potentially dangerous scenarios and
  edge-cases
- Interaction with 3rd party contracts
- Use of solidity best practices
- Permissions and roles after deploy script is executed

## Findings

Each issue has an assigned severity:

- <span
  style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Informational</span>
- <span
  style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Minor</span>
  issues are subjective in nature. They are typically suggestions around best
  practices or readability. Code maintainers should use their judgement as to
  whether to address such issues.
- <span
  style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Gas</span>
  issues are related to gas optimizations.
- <span
  style="background:#f5e642;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Medium</span>
  issues are objective in nature but are not security vulnerabilities. These
  should be addressed unless there is a clear reason not
  to.
- <span
  style="background:#f57842;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold;color:white">High</span>
  issues are security vulnerabilities that may
  not be directly exploitable or may require certain conditions in order to be
  exploited. All major issues should be addressed.
- <span style="background:#eb3838; padding:4px; border-radius: 3px; font-weight:
  bold; color: white">Critical</span> issues are directly exploitable security
  vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.

## Detailed Findings

### <a name="1" />1. L2 token includes governance logic

**Severity:** <span style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Informational</span>

Typically, when briding an ERC20 token to a new chain, a bare token contract is used, with only minting and burning functionality included, since governance and other utility features need to be centralized on the main original chain.
The `OpBnbAliERC20v2` token inherits from `AliERC20v2Base`, and thus includes all the logic relating to governance and permissions that exists in this superclass. This is usually a strange choice, and no indication was given that this was a requirement, so it's highlighted here as an informational issue.

**Recomendation:** if it is indeed not needed in the Optimism chain, it is highly recommended that the author removes this logic and opts for a more barebones ERC20 implementation

### <a name="2" />2. L2 minting can be exploited by owner

**Severity:** <span style="background:#f57842;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold;color:white">High</span>

A typical bridged ERC20 contract grants minting permissions only to the bridge contract. However, in `OpBnbAliERC20v2`, this is still controled through `ROLE_TOKEN_CREATOR`, which can be arbitrarily edited by an authorized admin. This is inconsistent with bridging logic, as there is presumably no scenario under which this is a desired feature, and it incur in loss of trust from the users. If ever used, it can also cause accounting issues with the bridge itself, as it would unbalance the supply available on the original L1, and thus making that extra supply un-bridgeable.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability for owners to define additional minting/burning roles post-deploy.

### <a name="3" />3. Redundant gas estimation

**Severity:** <span style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Gas</span>
`LzERC20RootTunnelV1.__sendMessageToChild` first calls `__estimateMessageFee`, to calculate the value to be sent down to `lzEndpoint.send`.

However, this logic seems to only ensure that `msg.value` is enough to cover it, and manually returns any excess at the end of the function. The Layer Zero endpoint itself [takes care of this already](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/interfaces/evm-solidity-interfaces/ilayerzeroendpoint), meaning the function can be greatly simplified:

```diff
function __sendMessageToChild(bytes memory message) private {
-   // estimate message fee
-   uint256 fee = __estimateMessageFee(message);

-   // make sure the message sending is paid
-   require(msg.value >= fee, "send underpriced");
-
    // send the message
-	lzEndpoint.send{value: fee}(
+	lzEndpoint.send{value: msg.value}(
        childTunnelChainId,
        abi.encodePacked(childTunnelAddress, address(this)),
        message,
        payable(msg.sender),
        address(0),
        bytes("")
    );

-   // if sender sent more than required
-   if(msg.value > fee) {
-       // send the delta back to sender
-       payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value - fee);
-   }
}
```

The same applies to `LzERC20ChildTunnelV1.__sendMessageToChild`.

### <a name="4" />4. No way to rescue native token

**Severity:** <span style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Informational</span>

The `LzERC20RootTunnelV1.rescueToken` and `LzERC20ChildTunnelV1.rescueToken` functions exist to rescue accidentally sent ERC20 tokens. Presumably, a similar function should exist to retrieve accidentally sent ETH.

### <a name="5" />5. `setup-OpBnbAliERC20v2` comment needs clarification

**Severity:** <span style="background:#bbb;padding:4px;border-radius:3px;font-weight:bold">Minor</span>

`deploy/v2_8/setup-OpBnbAliERC20v2` states in comments:

```js
// verify if transfers are enabled and enable if required
```

However, the following line is enabling all features (`FEATURE_ALL`) rather than just transfer-related ones

This also applies to `setup-ChildAliERC20v2`.
